# C-Doku
## Project Description
An interactive sudoku game implemented in C!
This project allows a user to play an interactive sudoku game implemented in C in terminal. After the terminal prints a visualization of an incomplete board, the user can specify a number to input into a specific row and column. The visualization will continue updating based on the user input. The player wins if they get less than three errors before the board is completed!

## Dependencies
To play the game, download all the files from our C-Doku repository. You can also download it directly here. 

## Instructions
After downloading the files within the repository, run the following command in the terminal to get into the source directory:
```
$ cd path-to-file/C-Doku-main/src
```
Then, run the following code to run and begin the game:
```
$ gcc main.c && ./a.out
```
Have fun playing the game!
