# C-Doku
## Project Description
An interactive sudoku game implemented in C!
This project allows a user to play an interactive sudoku game implemented in C in terminal. After the terminal prints a visualization of an incomplete board, the user can specify a number to input into a specific row and column. The visualization will continue updating based on the user input. The player wins if they get less than three errors before the board is completed!

We used [this board puzzle](https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sudoku-Puzzle_01.pdf) to create our game. 

## Dependencies
To play the game, download all the files from our [C-Doku repository](https://github.com/olincollege/C-Doku). You can also download it directly [here](https://github.com/olincollege/C-Doku/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 

## Instructions
After downloading the files within the repository, run the following command in the terminal to get into the source directory:
```
$ cd path-to-file/C-Doku-main/src
```
Then, run the following code to run and begin the game:
```
$ gcc main.c && ./a.out
```
Have fun playing the game!
