# C-Doku
## Project Description
An interactive sudoku game implemented in C!
C-Doku is a C implementation of Sudoku in your very own terminal! The game prints a beautiful visualization of an incomplete board for a player to solve based on the level they chose, and the user can specify a number to input into a specific row and column. The visualization will continue updating based on the user input. The player wins if they get less than three errors before the board is completed!

We used [these board puzzles]([https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sudoku-Puzzle_01.pdf](https://www.rd.com/list/printable-sudoku-puzzles/)) to create our game. 

## Dependencies
To play the game, download all the files from our [C-Doku repository](https://github.com/olincollege/C-Doku). You can also download it directly [here](https://github.com/olincollege/C-Doku/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 

## Instructions
After downloading the files within the repository, run the following command in the terminal to get into the source directory:
```
$ cd path-to-file/C-Doku-main/src
```
Then, run the following code to run and begin the game:
```
$ gcc main.c && ./a.out
```
Have fun playing the game!
